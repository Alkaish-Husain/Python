'''Exception handling makes a program more user-friendly by preventing it from crashing unexpectedly and providing clear, helpful error messages.
Without exception handling, unexpected issues like invalid user input, file not found errors, or division by zero could cause the program to terminate abruptly,
confusing the user. By using try-except blocks, the program can catch errors gracefully and display meaningful messages,
guiding the user to correct their input or retry an operation.
For example, if a user enters text instead of a number, the program can catch the ValueError and prompt them to enter a valid number. '''
